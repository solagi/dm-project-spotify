# Project abstract
**Research question**: How can a classification model be trained and used to predict if a song has the desired musical characteristics to be featured in Spotifyâ€™s popular playlists?

**Methods and Data**: 

Main methods used in this study are KMeans clustering and SVM classification models. KMeans is applied to examine if it is possible to find distinct clusters in our data based on the musical
features, and see how they compare with labeled playlists. Furtheron, the SVM classification model is build using the polynomial kernel to get a model that can classify new songs into the set of chosen playlists.

The data was gathered from Spotify and include an excessive amount of features for each song in each of the chosen top playlists.
